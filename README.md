IPHONE CALCULATOR
A simple calculator project

*Inspiration: 
As someone who is just starting her journey as a developer, I needed to test my skills and abilities to see what I can possibly build to keep the flame of the passion in me burning.

*What it does: 
This is a simple front-end iphone calculator

*How I built it:
- Firstly, I designed my Project Structure by making a rough sketch of what I wanted it to look like
- Used Vscode as my code editor
- Then I went ahead to create my html file and my css file
- Started writing my codes, till the final result was achieved

*Challenges I faced:
- As a beginner, I encountered so many bugs and errors in my code which took weeks to fix

* Accomplishment that I'm proud of:
This is basically the first project that I've successfully worked on, so it was a 'proud-beginner moment for me'

*What I learned
- I learnt about the box model, css display properties, grid, flex and a lot more

*What's next for IPHONE CALCULATOR
- Implementing the back-end and making it fully functional
